> A website created by a software developer for software developers

[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com)

On my [website](https://marprez.vercel.app), I share technical articles on software development using Python and its libraries for data science, Java, Vue, Javascript, and other programming languages. Apart from technical articles, I also showcase the courses and projects that I have created.

## Frameworks and software stacks

The following software stacks have been used in the development of this website:

- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [@nuxt/devtools](https://nuxt.com/modules/devtools)

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm run preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
